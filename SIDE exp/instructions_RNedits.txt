'On each trial of this experiment ';
' you will be presented with a study list of 2, 4 or 8 pictures.';

'The study list will either be presented either on the left side of the screen';
  'or on the right side of the screen.';

'Following the study list, you will be presented with a test picture and';
  'will be asked to judge if the test picture was OLD (on the study list)';
    'or NEW (not on the study list).';

'You will make your responses by pressing either the F key (LEFT) or the';
   'J key (RIGHT).';

'If the test picture was OLD, then press the key on the SAME side as the study list.';
'If the test picture was NEW, then press the key on the OPPOSITE side of the study list.';

'For example, if the study list was presented on the LEFT side of the screen, and the';
  'test picture was OLD, then press the LEFT key (F).   If the test picture was NEW,';
   'then press the RIGHT key (J).';

'OLD = press key on SAME side as study list,   NEW = press key on OPPOSITE side.';

'After a little bit of practice, you should get used to the procedure';
   'for making your old and new responses.';

'After you make your response, the computer will tell you if';
' you were correct or incorrect.';

'Please always rest your fingers on the F and J keys';
' and try to respond as quickly as you can without making errors.';

'The experiment has 9 blocks of trials with 25 trials in each block.';
'Please press SPACE to begin';
